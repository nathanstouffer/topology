This repository contains coursework for Topology (M 476) at Montana State University.

This is an undergraduate level Topology course, so the proofs are not as rigorous as published mathematics would require. Each homework has its own directory.

Past HW5, the proofs that I wrote for this class became more reliant on drawings and pictures. As the instructor allowed handwritten submissions, I figured that it was not worth my time to write the electronic versions of my homework.
