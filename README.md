This repository contains coursework for Topology (M 476) at Montana State University.

This is an undergraduate level Topology course, so the proofs are not as rigorous as published mathematics would require. Each homework has its own directory.

Past HW5, the proofs that I wrote for this class became more reliant on drawings and pictures. As the instructor allowed handwritten submissions, I figured that it was not worth my time to write the electronic versions of my homework.

The clustering directory contains a python script to visualize two sets of points (one a subset of R^2, the other a subset of R^3). I wrote the script because we used those two sets of points as examples for a project focused on persistent homology.

The directory P_4 is a python program that displays all elements of P_4 (the set of equilateral 4-gons in the plane up to translation and rotation). Note that, P_4 can be considered a graph as a subset of the torus S^1 \cross S^1
